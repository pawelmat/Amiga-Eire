                                        THE ROOM ILLUMINATED BY THE FAMILIAR AMIGA SCREEN GLOW, ITS FLICKERING CRT LIGHT PAINTING THEIR FACES IN ELECTRIC NOSTALGIA. FINGERS ON THE KEYBOARD, SCULPTING CPU TRICKS LIKE POETRY, CHIP MODS SPUN FROM FADING DREAMS, PIXELS BRINGING FORGOTTEN SHAPES TO LIFE. ONCE IT HAD BEEN DEMOS, COMPOS, PARTIES... NOW JUST ECHOES, CONTACTS LONG SILENT, GREETS SENT TO VANISHED GHOSTS OF THE PAST. AND YET THEY KEEP GOING, BYTES SHIMMERING UNDER THEIR FINGERTIPS. ONE LAST STRETCH TO HONOUR WHAT ONCE WAS. NO FAME, NO PRIZE, JUST SYNC AND SOUL...

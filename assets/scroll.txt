                                         THE BASEMENT WAS ILLUMINATED BY THE FAMILIAR AMIGA SCREEN GLOW, ITS FLICKERING CRT LIGHT PAINTING HIS FACE IN ELECTRIC NOSTALGIA. ALONE, HE SCULPTED COPPER EFFECTS LIKE POETRY, LOOPING MODS SPUN FROM FADING DREAMS. ONCE, IT HAD BEEN A TEAM: DEMOS, INTROS, PIXEL WARS... NOW JUST ECHOES, SWAPPER ADDRESSES LONG DEAD, GREETS SENT TO VANISHED GHOSTS OF THE PAST. HIS CODE STILL BORE THEIR NAMES, STITCHED IN SILENCE. OUTSIDE, THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENT, ALIEN, INCOMPREHENSIBLE. INSIDE, BITPLANES SHIMMERED UNDER HIS FINGERTIPS. NO FAME, NO PRIZE, JUST SYNC AND SOUL. HE CHASED ONE LAST FRAME-PERFECT RENDER, ONE LAST EFFECT TO HONOR WHAT ONCE WAS. IN EVERY FADE-IN, A MEMORY. IN EVERY BLITTER TRICK, A HEARTBEAT OF A SCENE THAT MOVED ON WITHOUT HIM. YET HE CODED, STUBBORN AS EVER, HIS IMAGINATION VIVID. A LONELY FIGURE, DANCING WITH BITS, CPU TICKS AND PIXELS IN THE SLOW DUSK OF RETRO GLORY...

# How to build and run
- Load workspace into Visual Studio Code
- Install the Amiga Assembly extension. Default setting should be fine although you might want to provide your own licensed Kickstart 1.3
- Press F5 to assemble and run in the embedded WinUAE. Uses vlink and vasmm68k_mot from VASM (embedded in the extension)

The output files are created in uae/dh0 which is automatically mapped as DH0 in the UAE embedded in the extension. 

Additionally you can press Ctrl-Shift-B to show the list of tasks configured in the project.
- 'build_debug' builds a debug version with symbols
- 'build_release' builds the release version with no symbols
- 'shrink runs' shrinkler (embedded in the project) to pack the executable (it also adds the .exe extension)
- 'prepare assets' runs a batch script preparing some of the assets - converting .iff and .mod files to what the intro requires. This has to be done only once.
